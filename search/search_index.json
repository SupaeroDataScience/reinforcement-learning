It aims to provide both a solid theoretical foundation and a quick learning curve towards current Deep RL algorithms. It starts with the fundamental notions underlying RL: Markov Decision Processes, model-based resolution approaches including Dynamic Programming, sample-based resolution of the Bellman equation. This leads to the identification of the three bottomline challenges in RL: function approximation, the exploration/exploitation trade-off and the search for optimality. This provides perspective to the following classes that introduce methods designed to tackle these challenges, including Deep RL methods. By the end of the class, students should be able to understand the literature on RL, implement key algorithms, and anticipate the difficulties of applying RL to various problems.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#class-material","title":"Class material","text":"<p>The class is split into a series of notebooks that serve as lecture material, textbook and exercice book.</p> <p>Open the notebooks in Binder: </p>"},{"location":"index.html#additional-resources","title":"Additional resources","text":"<p>Great books available online: Reinforcement Learning, an introduction Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning An introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning</p> <p>FAQ on installing Gym for Mac users</p>"},{"location":"index.html#class-schedule","title":"Class schedule","text":"Schedule MDPs and their resolution 08h30 - 11h45 03/02/2021 RL intuitions, Markov Decision Processes, Dynamic Programming Sample-based policy search 08h30 - 11h45 09/02/2021 Formulations of RL algorithms, Temporal Differences, Q-learning, the 3 bottlenecks of RL Value function approximation 13h00 - 16h15 09/02/2021 Linear approximations, Deep Q-Networks Policy gradients 09h00 - 12h15 15/02/2021 PG and Deep PG methods MCTS 09h00 - 12h15 17/02/2021 Monte Carlo Tree Search open 13h45 - 17h00 17/02/2021 open session on an RL challenge"},{"location":"RL0-intro.html","title":"Introduction to Reinforcement Learning","text":"<ul> <li>Home</li> <li>Github repository</li> </ul> <p>This class offers a \"getting started\" session on Reinforcement Learning.

Our focus is on controling such systems. For this we want to characterize what makes a policy optimal and how to find it.

When the approximation is done by performing stochastic approximation, we obtain the Q learning algorithm. We saw it was straightforward to extend this to use experience replay memories and batch stochastic gradient descent. In this class, we combine the stochastic gradient descent approach with replay memories and represent Q as a neural network. This yields the Deep Q-Networks algorithm.</p> <p>Notebook</p>"}]}
