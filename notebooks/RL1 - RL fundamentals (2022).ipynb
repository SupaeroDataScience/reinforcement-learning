    "- one notebook to rule them all (them = the concepts)\n",
    "- no slides\n",
    "- short exercices along the way\n",
    "- a bit of live coding\n",
    "- two class breaks for you to breathe\n",
    "    \n",
    "What you should expect:\n",
    "- some plain words notions,\n",
    "- but avoidance of over-simplification,\n",
    "- and also a fair amount of (hopefully painless) rigorous notations and abstract concepts.\n",
    "- Also most things will be fully written down to increase your autonomy in replaying the notebook.\n",

    "This notebook was played in the [introductory course](https://rlvs.aniti.fr/rl-fundamentals.html) of the 2021 [Reinforcement Learning Virtual School](https://rlvs.aniti.fr) (video class available). The class lasted 3.5 hours (with breaks).  \n",

    "> The idea that we learn by interacting with our environment is probably the first to occur to us when we think about the nature of learning. When an infant plays, waves its arms, or looks about, it has no explicit teacher, but it does have a direct sensorimotor connection to its environment. Exercising this connection produces a wealth of information about cause and effect, about the consequences of actions, and about what to do in order to achieve goals. Throughout our lives, such interactions are undoubtedly a major source of knowledge about our environment and ourselves. Whether we are learning to drive a car or to hold a conversation, we are acutely aware of how our environment responds to what we do, and we seek to influence what happens through our behavior. Learning from interaction is a foundational idea underlying nearly all theories of learning and intelligence.

Actually, the contraction property of $T^*$ insures that the stationary policy $\\pi'$ that is greedy with respect to $Q^\\pi$ is at least as good as $\\pi$, that is $V^{\\pi'}\\geq V^\\pi$. Consequently, the sequence of policies defined by $\\pi_{n+1}(s) = \\arg\\max_{a\\in A} Q^{\\pi_n}(s,a)$ has a monotonically improving corresponding sequence of value functions $V^{\\pi_n}$ and converges to $\\pi^*$.<br>\n",

Even if all states are reachable from anywhere in the state space (ergodicity property), they might not all be visited with the same frequency and therefore the convergence to $Q^\\pi$ might be delayed because of this uniform exploration strategy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The same remark applies to $\\epsilon$-greedy exploration strategies that often start with $\\epsilon=1$ and let it slowly decrease towards zero. These strategies don't account for the actual *visitation frequencies* of state-action pairs. In some states it might be good to keep a strong exploration probability because they actually have been seldom visited, while in other states, a faster decrease is desirable. This links also to the question of *value propagation* that was underpinned by the asynchronous value iteration remarks in section 6.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The point here is to notice that $\\epsilon$-greedy is a simple, very naive exploration strategy that fits within the GLIE requirements but that much better exploration policies are possible by taking the current state into account (contextual exploration) or by using the values of the temporal difference (prioritized experience replay) and the $Q$ estimate (Boltzmann policies, $E^3$ or $R_{max}$ strategies) for instance."

    "###  Three intrinsic challenges in Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Many topics covered in this class would deserve a more in-depth coverage, but we can already identify three challenges that make the RL problem intrinsically difficult:\n",
    "- Function approximation,\n",
    "- The exploration versus exploitation trade-off,\n",
    "- The improvement problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen, **function approximation** is key in finding good policies. Although it needs not be tackled with stochastic gradient descent, the interplay between Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning has triggered major advances in RL.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RLVS classes about [Deep Q-Networks and its variants](https://rl-vs.github.io/rlvs2021/dqn.html) dive deeper into how one can implement Approximate Value Iteration with Deep Neural Networks, and what really are the associated optimization problems. A particular focus is given on how [Regularized MDPs](https://rl-vs.github.io/rlvs2021/regularized-mdps.html) bring a new perspective to Approximate Dynamic Programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior policies are a cornerstone of RL: which action should one take to obtain informative samples? Should one explore uniformly the environment or rather follow a policy that takes the system towards promising states before exploring more agressively? This is called the **tradeoff between exploration and exploitation**.\n",

They are complemented by the [Exploration in Deep RL](https://rl-vs.github.io/rlvs2021/exploration.html) class on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideas we developped in this class relied on estimating value functions to deduce greedy policies. Finding such greedy policies was made easy because actions were discrete. But **finding improving policies** is actually a challenge in itself.
