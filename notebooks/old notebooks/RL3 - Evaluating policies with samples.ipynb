    "Recall the discussion on the importance of the behavior distribution? We concluded that tabular representations were a specific case where TD(0) is truly off-policy because the influence of a sample was limited to the value of $Q$ in the corresponding $(s,a)$ pair. This discussion can be generalized for averagers (although it remains an approximation): such local models are well-behaved to suffer less from the shift in behavior distributions."

    "One quickly realizes that the frontier between parametric and non-parametric models is blur. In the general case of a $s \\mapsto V(s)$ function approximator, the general idea is to feed this approximator with samples of the form $(s, r+\\gamma V(s'))$. But beware: most of the nice results are generally lost when one leaves the realm of linear function approximation. More precisely, when one combines **function approximation**, **off-policy learning** and **bootstrapping** in a temporal difference method, all results are generally lost. This has been studied as the **[Deadly triad of Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02648v1)** (H. Van Hasselt et al., 2018)."
