    "    <summary markdown=\"span\"><b>What is the goal of the game?  Can you express it mathematically?</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "Tricky question and many possible answers here.  \n",
    "It seems most people try to obtain as much tea as possible.\n",
    "    But it quickly appears that since the game never stops, the amount of tea you can get is just infinite.  \n",
    "    So maybe the goal is to get tea as quickly as possible?  \n",
    "    But in this case, what does \"quickly\" mean?\n",
    "    Again, most people seem to consider \"quickly\" in the sense of \"I don't know when the game will stop but there is a certain non-zero probability of termination at each step and I want to drink as much tea as possible before this happens\".  \n",
    "    Let's write $1-\\gamma$ this termination probability (and assume that it is constant over time steps). Then each time step is a two-step process: first check if the game has ended, then maybe get some tea and keep playing. The game ends with probability $1-\\gamma$ and we get $0$ tea thereafter. So the amount of tea we can expect to get after time step $t$ is $\\gamma$ times whatever the future steps will bring. Let's call $R_t$ the amount of tea we collect at time step $t$. Then, formally, the amount of tea we can expect to obtain after $T$ time steps is $\\mathbb{E}\\left( \\sum_{t=0}^T \\gamma^t R_t \\right)$.  \n",
    "    So maybe the goal of the game is to find a way to maximize $\\mathbb{E}\\left( \\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\gamma^t R_t \\right)$ (the infinite horizon expected accumulated tea).  \n",
    "    Another frequent interpretation is to say \"I want to get the highest average inflow of tea possible over a certain horizon\".  \n",
    "    With the notation above and without termination probability, this average inflow is $\\mathbb{E}\\left( \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=0}^T R_t \\right)$.  \n",
    "    But again, we don't know when the game will end, so maybe the goal of the game is to maximize $\\lim_{T\\rightarrow \\infty} \\mathbb{E} \\left(\\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=0}^T R_t \\right)$.  \n",
    "    These two interpretations are the most common ones but many other are possible. For example you could wish to keep your tea intake as steady as possible. Or try to always have an odd cumulated amount of tea (you crazy fool!). Or you could try to get tea while avoiding a certain room (where you might believe a bear lives).  \n",
    "    Overall, the purpose of this open-ended question is to have a discussion about expressing and formalizing behavior objectives, i.e. \"what's your goal in this game?\" and \"what makes a strategy quantitatively better than another?\".\n",
